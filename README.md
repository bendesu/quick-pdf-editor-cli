# Quick PDF Editor

## üìñ Description

This project was originally developed for personal use, but it is now shared online for others who may find it useful. It is primarily designed for editing PDF files, such as modifying the table of contents. 

More features will be added as needed in future updates.

## üöÄ Features

- Edit and modify PDF table of contents  
- (Upcoming features will be added as needed)

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Ensure you have `Python` and `make` installed on your system.
- Download this repo and save it to your local folder

### Steps
```bash
# Install dependencies
make install

# Run the application
python ./main.py --help

# (Optional) Build the application as an executable and run it from the executable
make build & ./dist/main --help
```

## üõ† Usage

### Example 1: Update Table of Contents
 
To get started, create a file called `data.json` and use the following example JSON structure. This data represents a list of contents, each with an `title`, `page_num`, and `child_nodes`.

```json
[
  {
    "page_num": 1,
    "title": "Cover",
    "child_nodes": null
  },
  {
    "page_num": 5,
    "title": "Contents",
    "child_nodes": [
      {
        "page_num": 5,
        "title": "Chapter 1",
        "child_nodes": null
      },
      {
        "page_num": 6,
        "title": "Chapter 2",
        "child_nodes": null
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

Update a PDF file with a Table of Contents
```bash
python ./main.py UPDATE-CONTENT  -f "your-pdf-input-path" -c "./data.json" -o "new-pdf-output-path"
```

### Example 2: Export Table of Contents
```bash
python ./main.py EXPORT-CONTENT  -f "your-pdf-input-path" -o "table-of-contents-json-output-path"
```
